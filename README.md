# ‚úÖ Constraints Before Promoting a Child Domain DC.


## ‚úÖ **Required Ports for Parent-Child Domain Communication**

Ensure the following ports are open between the child and parent DCs:

| **Protocol** | **Port** | **Description**             |
|--------------|----------|-----------------------------|
| TCP/UDP      | 53       | DNS                          |
| TCP          | 88       | Kerberos                     |
| TCP          | 135      | RPC                          |
| TCP/UDP      | 389      | LDAP                         |
| TCP/UDP      | 445      | SMB                           |
| TCP          | 636      | LDAP over SSL                |
| TCP/UDP      | 3268     | Global Catalog               |


## **‚úÖ Example DNS Setup on Child Domain DC:**

üîß The child domain DC must use the parent domain DC as its primary DNS server.

| **Server Role**     | **IP Address**   | **DNS Configuration**       |
|---------------------|------------------|-----------------------------|
| Parent Domain DC     | 192.168.1.1      | Self (192.168.1.1)          |
| Child Domain DC      | 192.168.2.1      | 192.168.1.1 (Parent DC IP)  |

---

## **Summary of Constraints:**

| **Constraint**            | **Required?** | **Description**                                |
|---------------------------|---------------|------------------------------------------------|
| DNS Server Configuration   | ‚úÖ Yes        | Child DC must use the parent DC as DNS server. |
| Network Connectivity       | ‚úÖ Yes        | Ensure stable connectivity between DCs.        |
| Trust Relationship         | ‚úÖ Yes        | Automatic trust is created during promotion.   |
| Admin Credentials          | ‚úÖ Yes        | Use Domain Admin or Enterprise Admin.          |
| Time Synchronization       | ‚úÖ Yes        | Ensure time is synced between DCs.             |

## **1. Promoting a Windows Server to a Child Domain**

### **Step 1: Install AD DS Role**
1. Open **`Server Manager`** on your Windows Server.
2. Click **`Manage`** > **`Add Roles and Features`**.
3. Select **`Active Directory Domain Services`** and complete the wizard.

### **Step 2: Promote to a Child Domain**
1. After installing the role, click **`Notifications`** (the flag icon) in Server Manager.
2. Click **`Promote this server to a domain controller`**.
3. In the **`Deployment Configuration`** window:
   - Select **`Add a new domain to an existing forest`**.
   - Choose **`Child Domain`**.
   - Enter the parent domain name (e.g., `parent.com`) and the new child domain name (e.g., `child.parent.com`).

4. Provide **`Domain Administrator`** credentials for the parent domain.

5. Configure the following options:
   - **`Domain Controller Capabilities`**: Select **`DNS Server`** and **`Global Catalog (GC)`** as needed.
   - **`Site Name`**: Choose an appropriate site name for the child domain.

6. Complete the **`DNS options`** and **`Paths`** configuration.

7. Review the configuration and click **`Install`**.

8. Once the server restarts, the child domain will be created.

## **2. Creating Sites and Subnets in Active Directory**

### **Step 1: Open Active Directory Sites and Services**
1. On a domain controller, open **Active Directory Sites and Services** (`dssite.msc`).

### **Step 2: Create a New Site**
1. Right-click **`Sites`** and select **`New Site`**.
2. Enter a **Site Name** (e.g., `Site1`).
3. Choose an appropriate **`Link Object`** (usually `DEFAULTIPSITELINK`).

### **Step 3: Create a New Subnet**
1. In **`Active Directory Sites and Services`**, right-click **`Subnets`** and select **`New Subnet`**.
2. Enter the **`IP Address`** and **`Subnet Mask`** (e.g., `192.168.1.0/24`).
3. Associate the subnet with the site you created earlier.

### **Step 4: Move Domain Controllers to Sites**
1. Expand the **`Servers`** node under your site.
2. Right-click the **`domain controller`** and select **`Move`**.
3. Choose the correct site.

## **3. Verification Steps**

1. Run **`ipconfig /all`** on the child domain controller to ensure it is properly registered with DNS.
2. Use **`Active Directory Users and Computers`** to verify the new child domain.
3. Check the **`Event Viewer`** for any errors or warnings.

---

## **4. Best Practices**

- Ensure all domain controllers have static IP addresses.
- Place **`Domain Controllers`** in appropriate sites to optimize replication.
- Use **`subnets`** to ensure clients authenticate with the closest domain controller.
- Regularly monitor **`replication health`** using tools like **`repadmin`**.

## **5. Troubleshooting**

| **Issue**                     | **Solution**                                                        |
|--------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Child domain promotion fails   | Ensure the parent domain controller is reachable and DNS is correctly configured. |
| Replication issues             | Use **`repadmin /showrepl`** to check replication status.            |
| Site not functioning correctly | Verify that the subnet is correctly linked to the site.              |



## ‚úÖ **Key Constraints Before Promoting a Child Domain DC:**

## ‚ùå **Common Issues if Constraints Are Not Met:**

| **Issue**                          | **Cause**                                                | **Solution**                                                |
|------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|
| DNS errors during promotion         | Child DC cannot locate parent DC                         | Set the **parent DC‚Äôs IP** as the **primary DNS server**.    |
| Network connectivity errors         | Firewall or routing issues between DCs                   | Ensure **ports are open** and **DCs can ping each other**.   |
| Authentication errors               | Incorrect credentials or trust issues                    | Use **Domain Admin** or **Enterprise Admin** credentials.    |
| Time sync errors                    | Time mismatch between parent and child DCs               | Sync time using **NTP server** or **parent DC**.             |

## **Conclusion**  

By following this guide, you have successfully promoted a Windows Server to a **`child domain`** and configured **`sites and subnets`** in **`Active Directory`**. This setup enhances the efficiency of your network by optimizing **`replication traffic`** and ensuring that **`clients authenticate`** to the nearest domain controllers.

Proper configuration of sites and subnets is essential for **`large, distributed networks`**, allowing for better performance, **`faster authentication`**, and **`efficient resource management`**. Remember to regularly monitor and maintain your AD infrastructure to ensure it remains secure, scalable, and resilient.
